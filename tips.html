                <h3><q>Fully vaccinated</q> doesn’t mean <q>immune to COVID-19</q></h3>
                <br>  
                <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully 
                    vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still 
                    isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that 
                    you could become infected.</p> 
                <br>   
                <p>Dr. Cardona explains.</p>
                <br>
                <p><q>'Fully vaccinated'  means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for 
                    the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
                    vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off 
                    the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.</q></p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people?</h3>

                    <br>


                    <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
                        rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
                        response to vaccines. </p>
                    <p><q>The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
                        disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 
                        vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in 
                        these vulnerable populations.</q></p>
